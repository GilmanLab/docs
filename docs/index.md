# Welcome to Gilman Lab

Gilman Lab (glab for short) is a personal project started by Joshua Gilman in
order to learn and apply best practices for managing a modern application
deployment environment. Much of the project is heavily influenced by DevOps
practices and is geared towards "automation first" where applicable. The
infrastructure for the project is provided by a homelab environment and is
primarily powered by
[VMWare vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere.html). The primary
purpose of this documentation is to provide a reference for the architecture of
the lab, provide additional details for internal workings, and provide useful
procedures for performing day-to-day in the lab environment. The secondary
purpose of this documentation is to provide a learning opportunity for others
(especially those in the homelab community) as well as document the project for
parties who have been directed here from a resume.

This documentation is broken up into logical segments to ease the process of
finding the desired information. Additionally, the search box located in the
header can be used for locating specific information by keyword. The
documentation is automatically generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
and uses the popular [material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
theme. It is hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the source
code for the documentation can be found in its
[repository](https://github.com/GilmanLab/docs).

# Project Structure

All components of glab have been incorporated into the "Gilman Lab" Github
organization. The repositories held within combine to form the source code and
configuration of the entire project. Currently, the project is organized as
follows:

- [GilmanLab/cluster](https://github.com/GilmanLab/cluster) - Currently consists
  of a Kapitan inventory used to build and deploy the glab k8s clusters. This
  portion is evolving frequently and will likely change in the future.
- [GilmanLab/dev](https://github.com/GilmanLab/dev) - Configuration files for
  setting up a dev environment to work on glab
- [GilmanLab/docs](https://github.com/GilmanLab/docs) - The source code for this
  documentation
- [GilmanLab/images](https://github.com/GilmanLab/images) - Packer
  configurations for the base images that form the glab infrastructure
- [GilmanLab/precommit](https://github.com/GilmanLab/precommit) - Custom
  pre-commits to enforce consistency across files
